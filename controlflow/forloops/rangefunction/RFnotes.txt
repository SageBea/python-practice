To loop through a set of code a specified number of times - use range ( ) function.

Annotation: why Parenthesis?
            ( ) are used for functions, grouping, and tuples


range () function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default) and ends at a specific number.

Annotation: Can i change the start,and its increments? 
            yes



*Basic Counting Loop
ex: pythonfoundations/controlflow/forloops/rangefunction/rangefuntion101.py
/Users/sagebeastly/VSPlayground/pythonfoundations/controlflow/forloops/rangefunction/rangefuntion101.py

for x in range(6):
    print(x) 

range(6) would mean the values 0 to 5
output: 0 1 2 3 4
When/Why: Use this when you want to repeat something a certain number of times, 
like printing or calculating 5 times.



* to change the starting parameter
ex: pythonfoundations/controlflow/forloops/rangefunction/rf-startingparameter101.py
/Users/sagebeastly/VSPlayground/pythonfoundations/controlflow/forloops/rangefunction/rf-startingparameter101.py

for x in range(2,6 ):
    print(x)

range(2, 6) means values from 2 to 6 but not including 6
Output 2 3 4 5
When/Why: Use this when you don’t want to start at zero — for example, iterating through a specific 
section of numbers.



*  to use a step value
ex: pythonfoundations/controlflow/forloops/rangefunction/rf-incrementsequence.py
/Users/sagebeastly/VSPlayground/pythonfoundations/controlflow/forloops/rangefunction/rf-incrementsequence.py

for x in range(2,30,3):
    print(x)

range(2,30,3) specify the increment value by adding a third parameter
output: 2 5 8 ...

When/Why: The third number (2) is the step size. Use it when you want to skip numbers or move in 
increments — useful for even/odd loops or time intervals.

Annotation: Will adding more parameters mean different things or destroy the "syntax".
for now; (starting parameter,the number of loops i think,and its increments.)
            Range(Start, stop, step) anything more destroys syntax 

Annotation: just one number in the range means it loops starting at 0 to the x-1,because 0 value means it loops zero times. yet,some houw its still an actual outcome...
why would anything loop zero- what whould that look like?
            zero is the first position in programming. programming counts position not quantities.





The range() function in Python generates a sequence of numbers and is most often used in for loops 
to control how many times a loop runs. It can take one, two, or three arguments: range(stop), 
range(start, stop), or range(start, stop, step). This makes it useful for counting, iterating 
through lists by index, skipping numbers, or running tasks a specific number of times.
