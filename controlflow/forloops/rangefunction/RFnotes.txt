To loop through a set of code a specified number of times - use range ( ) function.

Annotation: why Parenthesis?

range () function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default) and ends at a specific number.

Annotation: Can i change the start,and its increments?

for x in range(6):
    print(x)
