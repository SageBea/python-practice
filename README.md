# Python Practice

This repository contains my Python learning exercises, practice scripts, and small projects.  
Itâ€™s part of my journey to mastering **Python**, **data analysis**, and building a strong foundation for my upcoming tech career.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the types of files youâ€™ll find here:

- **Basic Python Syntax** â€“ print statements, variables, strings
- **Control Flow** â€“ if/else statements, loops (`for` and `while`)
- **Functions** â€“ reusable blocks of code
- **Data Structures** â€“ lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- **File Handling** â€“ reading from and writing to files

## ðŸ›  How to Run the Scripts
Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your computer.  
To run any script in this repo, open your terminal and type:

```bash
python3 filename.py


## ** Goals of This Repository**
Strengthen my Python fundamentals
Learn data structures and file handling
Prepare for real-world projects and data science work
Build a public portfolio on GitHub
