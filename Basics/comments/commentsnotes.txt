Comments are left to explain the code, make code more readable,to prevent executeion when testing code
comments start with # 
    #this is a comment
    # and this is a comment

comments can be placed before the block of code or inline with the code at python will ignore it
ex:
    print("Hello") #This is a comment :)
    
A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, 
it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
ex:
    #print("Hello, World!")
    print("Cheers, Mate!")

1. WHy would that stop it from executing?
        this means it can be used as an afterthought for stopping the execution, but keep the code.


Python doesnt have syntax for multiline comments. just ass a # to every line

#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

we can replicate a "multiline string - comment" by using triple quotes.
ex:
    """
    This is a comment
    written in
    more than just one line
    """
    print("Hello, World!")

- as long as the string is not assigned to avariable,Python will read it,but ignore it.
