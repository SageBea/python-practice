VARIABLEs
Variables are containers for storing data values
        - Variables act like labeled boxes in memory where Python stores info we want to use later.

        -We give the box a name (the Variable), and we can put sumn in the box... 
        a number,text, or list of items.

Python has no command for declaring a variable 
variables are created once we aissgn value

                                            - are we creating value with = ?
                                            - are all words to be quoted?
    Ex:
        x = 5
        y = "John"

A variable is a named container that stores a piece of data, so you can use it later.
You create one by giving it a name and using the = sign to assign a value (for example, x = 5
or name = "sage"). Variables can store numbers, text, and other types of data. They make your code
reusable and flexible, since you can use the same variables name to hold new values as your program runs.





Variables dont need declaring with a specsific type, and can change after set,
    Ex:
    x = 4       # x is of type int
    x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
    print(x)
                                            -What are Types?
| Type    | Name           | Example                            | Description                                      |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `int`   | Integer        | `4`, `100`, `-25`                  | Whole numbers — used for counting, math, etc.    |
| `float` | Floating-point | `4.5`, `0.1`, `-3.14`              | Numbers with decimals.                           |
| `str`   | String         | `"Sally"`, `'Python'`              | Text — letters, words, sentences.                |
| `bool`  | Boolean        | `True`, `False`                    | True or False values, used for logic.            |
| `list`  | List           | `[1, 2, 3]`, `["apple", "banana"]` | A collection of items in order.                  |
| `tuple` | Tuple          | `(1, 2, 3)`                        | Like a list, but cannot be changed.              |
| `dict`  | Dictionary     | `{"name": "Sally", "age": 4}`      | Key–value pairs, like labels and their meanings. |
| `set`   | Set            | `{1, 2, 3}`                        | Unordered collection of unique values.           |

Casting
If we want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting 

x = str(3) # x will be '3'
y = int(3) # y will be 3
z = float(3) # z will be 3.0


Get the type
We can get the data type fo variable with the Type
    Ex:
    x = 5
    y = "john"
    print(type(x))
    print(type(x))


Single or double quotes?
-String variables can be declared eitherby using single or double quotes:
    EX:
    x = "john"
    #is the same as 
    x = 'John'

Case sensitive
-Variables are case sensitive
EX:
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
