To program a computer is to give it a list of instructions to be "executed" by the computer.
the intructions are statements.

statements are instructions. syntax is the lanuuage? or the abc? how to formulate 
statements end when the line ends no need for ; like java or c 


statements are excuted one by one in the same order written. here are 3 statements.
print("Hello World!")
print("Have a good day.")
print("Learning Python is fun!")


Semicolons are optional in Python. 
write multiple statements on one line by separating them with ; but this is rarely used because it makes it hard to read:
  good:          print("Hello"); print("How are you?"); print("Bye bye!")

  error:         print("Python is fun!") print("Really!")
