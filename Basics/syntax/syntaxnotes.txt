there oare 2 options to excecute python syntax.
    1. directly into the terminal/commandline or
    2. create a .py file and run it in the terminal/command line 


    INDENTATION
    python uses indentation to indicate a block of code
ex:
        if 5 > 2:
            Print("five is greater than two!")
- skipping this will gove you an error
-the number of spaces or indentation is suject to the codermaster

but, we have to use the same amount of indentation when we writing in the same block of code:
    Ex:
        If 5 > 2:
            print("five is greater than 2")
                print ("five is greater than two")


    VARIABLES
ex:
    x = 5
    Y = "Hello, World"
-Python has no command for declaring Variables 
        What does that mean?
            -Python doesn’t require a command or keyword to declare variables. 
            You simply create one by assigning a value with =. 
            The variable’s type is decided automatically by the value you give it. 
            For example, x = 5 makes x an integer, and x = "hello" makes it a string. 
            This flexibility is part of what makes Python easy to learn and use.


    COMMENTS
    we can you comments for for in-code documentation.
ex:
    #this is a comment
    Print("Hello world")

    -at the end of a block of code, you can press shift+Enter to run the code. :)
                this may be just in VS CODE - it was hard to remove, but it opened another terminal i could run it in.. i dont understand it.
            
    - it doesnt matter if there is a space next to ( print ("") ) or not (  Print ("")  )
            i tested this with nofear.py and sampf1.py 


    - im having trouble making this code do what i want... i want to have a list of variables.
    if a variable is picked i want to say " my number on fav movie is __) tthe cod ei have now doesn’t
    offer that really. the code now is:

                                # A modest list of some movies I love...Just playing with variables here.

                                    1 == Django
                                    2 == Kill Bill vol one through two
                                    3 == four rooms
                                    4 == Hateful eight

                                    if 1 is x
                                        print ("Yes, django is my number 1")

                                    if 2 is x 
                                        Print (" yes, KillBills are my number 2")

      I think i need a prompt that  will only all the typeing of 1,2,3,4.. when 1 is pressed it states Django, is my number one favorite movie.
      so maybe sumn like. printing a prompt that says " fond out hwat my favorote movies are. type 1,2,3, or 4 to see theire rank."
      . i think i need to start with print and a statement. a variable list, somthing that allows ppl to put an input. that input is x, then it prints x is my number _ movie..
      now i tink i need 2 variable list....
            
            final work:
                 i need print(), input(), if statements, variables

                 variables are movie1
                 x = input

                 Why put 2 == on the statement.
