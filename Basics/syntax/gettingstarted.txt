Windows/PC = CommandLine
Mac/Linux = Terminal 

To check Python is installed on each system:
CommandLine = >python --version
Terminal = Python --version

What is python?
Python is a Programming Language. its used by wring in python files ( .py ) 
and putting the files in interpreteor/terminal/commmandline to be executed/run

to create simple syntax or files
option 1:   create a file __.py 
                Hello.py for example
            print("__") is the syntax/formula because its simple and print=state/repeat
                print("yodelehewho") for example

    to run this script:
        commandline: >python hello.py
        Terminal: python3 hello.py
            it will show: yodelehewho 


to basically test a short code to skip writing it in a file. this can be done with any syntax/formula
option 2:   commandline: >python / py
            terminal: python3
                this will open a space to code
                use printprint("yodelehewho")
                it will show yodelehewho
                    must exit the space using Exit() (nothing goes inside)
